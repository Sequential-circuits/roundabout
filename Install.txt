Installation

The system depends on Spark and Proton. The first I believe anyone who works with Big Data should be able to install it, so I will skip it.

As for Proton, it can be installed with the command pip install python-qpid-proton.

Please note that Python 3.6 is not compatible with Spark Streaming.
