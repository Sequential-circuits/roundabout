Installation and use

The system depends on Spark and Proton. The first I believe anyone who works with Big Data should be able to install it, so I will skip it.

As for Proton, it can be installed with the command pip install python-qpid-proton.

To run the system, just type python car.py from the folder you downloaded the system and youÂ´ll see the script generating data and complaining it cannot connect with Spark. To run the roundabout, open a new screen and type in that same folder spark-submit roundabout.py 

Please note that if you are using python 2, the correct command in the car.py module is "import SocketServer", and if you are using python3, it is "import socketserver", otherwise you get "No module named blabla"

Also, note that Python 3.6 may not compatible with the Spark Streaming version you are running. In this case, you get a message such as:
 from pyspark import SparkContext, SparkConf
  File "<frozen importlib._bootstrap>", line 961, in _find_and_load
  File "<frozen importlib._bootstrap>", line 950, in _find_and_load_unlocked
etc etc...
Should you have it installed and your python was installed with Anaconda (which I highly recommend as it comes with all the packages you could dream of), you can try typing conda create -n py35 python=3.5 anaconda and then source activate py35 to activate python 3.5. In this case you will need to also install proton in this python version too as instructed above.

You will see in the roundabout screen it receiving the data from the car, and in the car screen it getting data back from the roundabout.
